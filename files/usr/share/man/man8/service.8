.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBSERVICE\fR parameter specifies a systemd service name to operate on.
The supported values of \fBACTION\fR depend  on  the specified  service.
The actions start, stop, reload, restart, try-restart, force-reload, and status
are forwarded to systemctl, \fBOPTIONS\fR are ignored in that case.

The \-\-status-all option displays the status of all loaded service units.

.SH HISTORY
service used to run System V init scripts in a predictable environment.

.SH USE AS rc* WRAPPER
SUSE Linux distributions used to have convenience symlinks to call
System V init scripts, for example /usr/sbin/rcexample ->
/etc/init.d/example. With the move to systemd this has been deprecated and the
rc* symlinks will be removed.
