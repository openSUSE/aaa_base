.SH NAME
resolv+ \- enhanced DNS resolver library

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Resolv+
is a modified version of the standard Berkeley
BIND host resolver library. Enhancements include support
for host lookups via the Internet Domain Name System
(DNS), the
.IR /etc/hosts
file, and Sun's Network Information
Service (NIS).

The programmer interface to the resolv+ routines is identical
to that of the standard resolver library. For further information
see the appropriate manual pages.

.SH CONFIGURATION
As with the standard resolver library, the file
.IR /etc/resolv.conf
must be set up before the resolver can function.
In addition, the file
.IR /etc/host.conf
contains configuration information specific to resolv+.

The
.IR host.conf
file should contain one configuration keyword per line,
followed by appropriate configuration information.
The keywords recognized are
.IR order ,
.IR trim ,
.IR multi ,
.IR nospoof ,
and
.IR reorder .
Each keyword is described seperately below.
.IP order
This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be performed.
It should be followed by one or more lookup methods, seperated
by commas. Valid methods are
.IR bind ,
.IR hosts
and
.IR nis .
.IP trim
This keyword may be listed more than once. Each time it should
be followed by a single domain name, with the leading dot.
When set, the resolv+ library will automatically trim the given domain
name from the end of any hostname resolved via DNS.
This is intended for use with local hosts and
domains. (Related note: trim will not affect host-
names gathered via NIS or the hosts file. Care
should be taken to insure that the first hostname
for each entry in the hosts file is fully qualified
or non-qualified, as appropriate for the local
installation.)
.IP multi
Valid values are
.IR on
and
.IR off .
If set to "on," the resolv+ library will return all valid addresses
for a host that appears in the
.IR /etc/hosts
file, instead of only the first. This is off by default, as it
may cause a substantial performance loss at sites
with large hosts files.
.IP nospoof
Valid values are
.IR on
and
.IR off .
If set to "on," the
resolv+ library will attempt to prevent hostname
spoofing to enhance the security of
.IR rlogin
and
.IR rsh .
It works as follows: after performing a host
address lookup, resolv+ will perform a hostname
lookup for that address. If the two hostnames do
not match, the query will fail.
.IP alert
If this option is set to "on" and the
.IR nospoof
option is also set, resolv+ will log a warning of
the error via the
.IR syslog
facility. The default value is off.
.IP reorder
Valid values are
.IR on
and
.IR off .
If set to "on," resolv+ will attempt to reorder host addresses so
that local addresses (i.e., on the same subnet) are
listed first when a gethostbyname() is performed.
Reordering is done for all lookup methods.  The
default value is off.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables may be set to override
resolv+'s configured behavior:
.IP RESOLV_HOST_CONF
If set, it will override the default filename
("/etc/host.conf") for the resolv+ configuration
file.
.IP RESOLV_SERV_ORDER
If set, will override the "order" keyword in the
host.conf file.
.IP RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK
If set, will override the spoof check flag. Valid
values are "off" to disable checking, "warn" to
enable checking and warning, and "warn off" to
enable checking but not warning.
.IP RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS
If set, contains a list of domains to trim that
will augment, not supersede, the list in the
host.conf file.
.IP RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS
If set, contains a list of domains to trim that
will override those in the host.conf file.
.IP RESOLV_MULTI
If set, overrides the "multi" keyword in the
host.conf file.
.IP RESOLV_REORDER
If set, overrides the "reorder" keyword in the
host.conf file.
.SH FILES
/etc/host.conf, /etc/hosts
.SH BUGS
Quite possibly.
