.TH DEFAULTDOMAIN 5 2002-01-16 "SuSE Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
defaultdomain \- file which contains the NIS/YP domain name
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/defaultdomain\fP is used by the boot scripts to set
the NIS/YP domain name for a system as returned by the
.BR getdomainname (2)
function. The file contains one line with the name of the domain.

.LP
Unlike DNS hostnames and domain names, the NIS domain name is
case-sensitive! The NIS domain name must not be the same as the
DNS domain name, but for some services like NIS+ it should be the
same.

.LP
Even if the domain name is often called NIS/YP domain name, it is
also used from other protocols, not only NIS/YP.

/etc/defaultdomain
/etc/init.d/boot.localnet
