# Yama is a Kernel LSM to restrict ptrace, see
# https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.html


# ptrace_scope can be set to the following values

# 0 - classic ptrace permissions
# 1 - restricted ptrace:
#     a process must have a predefined relationship with the inferior it wants
#     to call PTRACE_ATTACH on.  By default, this relationship is that of only
#     its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met
#     To change the relationship, an inferior can call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER,
#     debugger, ...) to declare an allowed debugger PID to call PTRACE_ATTACH
#     on the inferior.
# 2 - admin-only attach:
#     only processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE may use ptrace
# 3 - no attach:
#     no process may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH. Once set, this sysctl value
#     cannot be changed.
#
# The default value of ptrace_scope is 1. Any value other than 0 will break some
# legitimate usecases.
